And for the first time, Peabody is primary detective on the case, which means she has to get used to a new level of authority and responsibility. Good thing she learned the ropes from a master like Eve.<br /><br />But after rounding up the perps, Peabody stumbles upon a much trickier situation. Determined to start working out as hard as she grills suspects, she chooses to do it at the old, rarely-used gym at Central. After a grueling workout, she squeezes into one of the narrow shower stalls, happy to have the place to herself. Just after she shuts the water off, the gym door clatters open - and while she cringes inside the stall, trying not to make a sound, Peabody overhears two fellow officers, Garnet and Oberman, arguing. References are made to delivering product, and a house in the islands, and someone named Keener who\u2019s supposed to look like an OD. It doesn\u2019t take long for a naked and vulnerable Peabody to realize that both officers are crooked - guilty not just of corruption but of murder as well. Fortunately, the two clear out of the locker room without realizing there was a witness.<br /><br />Eve Dallas may have trained Peabody well - but this is too dangerous for one person to take on alone. Now Peabody, Eve, and her husband, Roarke, must try to get the hard evidence they need to bring the dirty cops down - knowing all the while that the two have already killed to keep their secret, and are no doubt willing to do it again."}, {"wrapperType": "track", "kind": "song", "artistId": 238354, "collectionId": 1592991593, "trackId": 1592991855, "artistName": "Sir Colin Davis & London Symphony Orchestra", "collectionName": "Holst: The Planets, Op. 32", "trackName": "The Planets, Op. 32: IV.

Jack and Annie have met knights, pirates, ninjas, and Vikings, but they have never met the most fearsome warriors of all: Roman soldiers. When the magic tree house whisks them back to the early 100s AD, Jack and Annie find themselves in a Roman camp. Their mission: <i>Be like a warrior</i>. That is easier said than done! The Roman soldiers are much scarier in person--and suspicious of strangers. Then a mysterious man riding a black horse gives Jack and Annie some advice to help them on their mission. But the man may not be who he seems. Will Jack and Annie be good warriors? Can they learn what makes the Roman soldiers so great? And who is the mysterious rider . . . ?<br /><br /><b><i>To the Future, Ben Franklin!</i></b><b>:</b> Jack and Annie know all about Ben Franklin. He was a founding father, a journalist, and a famous inventor! When the magic tree house whisks them back to meet the man himself, they're not sure what their mission is. But Ben Franklin has a mission of his own. Intrigued by Jack and Annie, he's curious to learn more about where they came from. And very curious about their tree house. . . ."}, {"wrapperType": "track", "kind": "song", "artistId": 3628117, "collectionId": 1440944580, "trackId": 1440944834, "artistName": "KIDZ BOP Kids",

BESTSELLER \u2022 Hailed by Anthony Bourdain as \u201cheartbreaking, horrifying, poignant, and inspiring,\u201d <i>32 Yolks </i>is the brave and affecting coming-of-age story about the making of a French chef, from the culinary icon behind the renowned New York City restaurant Le Bernardin.</b><br /><br /><b>NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY NPR</b><br /><br /> In an industry where celebrity chefs are known as much for their salty talk and quick tempers as their food, Eric Ripert stands out. The winner of four James Beard Awards, co-owner and chef of a world-renowned restaurant, and recipient of countless Michelin stars, Ripert embodies elegance and culinary perfection. But before the accolades, before he even knew how to make a proper hollandaise sauce, Eric Ripert was a lonely young boy in the south of France whose life was falling apart.<br /><br /> Ripert\u2019s parents divorced when he was six, separating him from the father he idolized and replacing him with a cold, bullying stepfather who insisted that Ripert be sent away to boarding school. A few years later, Ripert\u2019s father died on a hiking trip. Through these tough times, the one thing that gave Ripert comfort was food. Told that boys had no place in the kitchen, Ripert would instead watch from the doorway as his mother rolled couscous by hand or his grandmother pressed out the buttery dough for the treat he loved above all others,&#xa0;<i>tarte aux pommes</i>. When an eccentric local chef took him under his wing, an eleven-year-old Ripert realized that food was more than just an escape: It was his calling. That passion would carry him through the drudgery of culinary school and into the high-pressure world of Paris\u2019s most elite restaurants, where Ripert discovered that learning to cook was the easy part\u2014surviving the line was the battle.<br /><br />Taking us from Eric Ripert\u2019s childhood in the south of France and the mountains of Andorra into the demanding kitchens of such legendary Parisian chefs as Jo\u00ebl Robuchon and Dominique Bouchet, until, at the age of twenty-four, Ripert made his way to the United States, <i>32 Yolks </i>is the tender and richly told story of how one of our greatest living chefs found himself\u2014and his home\u2014in the kitchen.<br /><br /> <b>Praise for&#xa0;<i>32 Yolks</i></b><br /><br />\u201cPassionate, poetical . . . What makes <i>32 Yolks</i> compelling is the honesty and laudable humility Ripert brings to the telling.\u201d<b>\u2014<i>Chicago Tribune</i></b><br /><br /> \u201cWith a vulnerability and honesty that is breathtaking . . . Ripert takes us into the mind of a boy with thoughts so sweet they will cause you to weep.\u201d<b>\u2014<i>The Wall Street Journal</i></b>"}, {"wrapperType": "track", "kind": "song", "artistId": 79980320, "collectionId": 594180316, "trackId": 594180910, "artistName": "Arthur Rubinstein", "collectionName": "Chopin: Nocturnes", "trackName": "Nocturnes, Op. 32: No. 1 in B Major", "collectionCensoredName": "Chopin: Nocturnes", "trackCensoredName": "Nocturnes, Op. 32: No. 1 in B Major", "artistViewUrl": "https://music.apple.com/us/artist/arthur-rubinstein/79980320?uo=4", "collectionViewUrl": "https://music.apple.com/us/album/nocturnes-op-32-no-1-in-b-major/594180316?i=594180910&uo=4", "trackViewUrl": "https://music.apple.com/us/album/nocturnes-op-32-no-1-in-b-major/594180316?i=594180910&uo=4", "previewUrl": "https://audio-ssl.itunes.apple.com/itunes-assets/AudioPreview125/v4/46/0c/82/460c82b9-2d52-c55a-8921-1925bd1b7465/mzaf_8627088287292748309.plus.aac.p.m4a", "artworkUrl30": "https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/94/5d/7f/945d7f2b-b387-9120-7e16-e0f004363b66/source/30x30bb.jpg", "artworkUrl60": "https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/94/5d/7f/945d7f2b-b387-9120-7e16-e0f004363b66/source/60x60bb.jpg", "artworkUrl100": "https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/94/5d/7f/945d7f2b-b387-9120-7e16-e0f004363b66/source/100x100bb.jpg", "collectionPrice": 10.99, "trackPrice": 1.29, "releaseDate": "1967-01-01T12:00:00Z", "collectionExplicitness": "notExplicit", "trackExplicitness": "notExplicit", "discCount": 1, "discNumber": 1, "trackCount": 19, "trackNumber": 9, "trackTimeMillis": 285721, "country": "USA", "currency": "USD", "primaryGenreName": "Classical", "isStreamable": true}, {"wrapperType": "audiobook", "artistId": 343739591, "collectionId": 1441502193, "artistName": "Zondervan", "collectionName": "Inspired By \u2026 The Bible Experience Audio Bible - Today's New International Version, TNIV: (32) John", "collectionCensoredName": "Inspired By \u2026 The Bible Experience Audio Bible - Today's New International Version, TNIV: (32) John", "artistViewUrl": "https://books.apple.com/us/artist/zondervan/343739591?uo=4", "collectionViewUrl": "https://books.apple.com/us/audiobook/inspired-by-the-bible-experience-audio-bible-todays/id1441502193?uo=4", "artworkUrl60": "https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music128/v4/5f/db/16/5fdb1673-415d-7bdc-d746-6a3563287ed6/9780310936053.jpg/60x60bb.jpg", "artworkUrl100": "https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music128/v4/5f/db/16/5fdb1673-415d-7bdc-d746-6a3563287ed6/9780310936053.jpg/100x100bb.jpg", "collectionPrice": 2.99, "collectionExplicitness": "notExplicit", "trackCount": 1, "country": "USA", "currency": "USD", "releaseDate": "2007-02-20T08:00:00Z", "primaryGenreName": "Religion & Spirituality", "previewUrl": "https://audio-ssl.itunes.apple.com/itunes-assets/AudioPreview123/v4/ab/de/d3/abded3f1-8d90-0566-0c31-a0cdab4ac497/mzaf_10242090286833793192.std.aac.p.m4a", "description": "The most ambitious, critically acclaimed presentation of the Bible ever produced<br /><br />Inspired By...

Or will it be curtains for Shakespeare?<br /><br /><b>#26: Good Morning, Gorillas</b><br />Gentle giants or giant monsters? That's the question Jack and Annie have about gorillas when the Magic Tree House sweeps them to the mountains of Africa. There they meet a group of amazing and sometimes frightening mountain gorillas. Annie knows how to play with the creatures right away. But Jack is left out. Will the gorillas be able to teach him some special magic?<br /><br /><b>#27: Thanksgiving on Thursday</b><br />It's a time for giving thanks when the Magic Tree House whisks Jack and Annie back to 1621 on the first Thanksgiving Day.

Or will the feast go on?<br /><br /><b>#28: High Tide in Hawaii</b><br />Catch the wave! That's what Jack and Annie do when the Magic Tree House whisks them back to a Hawaiian island of long ago.

Can they help save their new friends in time?<br /><br /><b>#29: A Big Day for Baseball</b><br />PLAY BALL! Jack and Annie aren\u2019t great baseball players . . . yet! Then Morgan the librarian gives them magical baseball caps that will make them experts. They just need to wear the caps to a special ballgame in Brooklyn, New York. The magic tree house whisks them back to 1947!&#xa0;When they arrive, Jack and Annie find out that they will be batboys in the game\u2014not ballplayers. What exactly does Morgan want them to learn?

When the magic tree house whisks them back to Galveston, Texas, in 1900, they find out that a big storm is coming. But even though there is rain and wind, no one believes there is any danger. As the storm grows, seawater floods the city. Now everyone needs help! Jack and Annie have a little bit of magic and a lot of hope\u2014but will it be enough?<br /><br /><b>#31: Warriors in Winter</b><br /><i>We are warriors!&#xa0;</i>Jack and Annie have met knights, pirates, ninjas, and Vikings, but they have never met the most fearsome warriors of all: Roman soldiers. When the magic tree house whisks them back to the early 100s AD, Jack and Annie find themselves in a Roman camp. Their mission:&#xa0;<i>Be like a warrior</i>.&#xa0;That is easier said than done! The Roman soldiers are much scarier in person\u2014and suspicious of strangers. Then a mysterious man riding a black horse gives Jack and Annie some advice to help them on their mission. But the man may not be who he seems. Will Jack and Annie be good warriors? Can they learn what makes the Roman soldiers so great? And who is the mysterious rider . . . ?<br /><br /><b>#32: To the Future, Ben Franklin!</b><br />Jack and Annie know all about Ben Franklin. He was a Founding Father, a journalist, and a famous inventor! When the magic tree house whisks them back to meet the man himself, they're not sure what their mission is. But Ben Franklin has a mission of his own. Intrigued by Jack and Annie, he's curious to learn more about where they came from. And<i>&#xa0;very</i>&#xa0;curious about their tree house. . . ."}]}
